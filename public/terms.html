        <p><strong>Last updated: July 17, 2025</strong></p>

        <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
        <p>
          By creating an account, or by using the Sellsnap website,
          applications, or services (collectively, the "Service"), you agree
          to be bound by these Terms and Conditions ("Terms"). If you do not
          agree to these Terms, do not use the Service. These Terms affect
          your legal rights and obligations, so please read them carefully.
        </p>

        <h2>2. The Service</h2>
        <p>
          Sellsnap provides an AI-powered service to help users generate
          e-commerce product listings, including titles, descriptions, and
          price analysis. The Service is accessible via our website and mobile
          applications.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Eligibility and User Accounts</h2>
        <p>
          You must be at least 18 years old to use the Service. By creating an
          account, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age. You
          are responsible for safeguarding your account password and for all
          activities that occur under your account. You must notify us
          immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Subscriptions and Payment</h2>
        <p>
          The Service is offered on a subscription basis. By selecting a
          subscription plan (monthly or yearly), you agree to pay the
          applicable subscription fees. Fees are billed in advance on a
          recurring basis. Subscriptions will automatically renew at the end
          of each billing cycle unless you cancel your subscription through
          your account management page or by contacting us. All fees are
          non-refundable except as required by law.
        </p>

        <h2>5. User Content</h2>
        <p>
          You retain ownership of all content you submit to the Service,
          including product photos and initial prompts ("User Content"). By
          using the Service, you grant Sellsnap a worldwide, non-exclusive,
          royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, and process your
          User Content solely for the purpose of providing and improving the
          Service for you. You are solely responsible for your User Content
          and assume all risks associated with it.
        </p>

        <h2>6. AI-Generated Content</h2>
        <p>
          The Service uses artificial intelligence to generate listing content
          ("AI Content"). While we strive for accuracy, we do not guarantee
          that the AI Content will be accurate, complete, or suitable for your
          purpose. You are responsible for reviewing and verifying all AI
          Content before use. Sellsnap is not liable for any errors,
          inaccuracies, or damages resulting from your use of AI Content.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
        <p>You agree not to use the Service to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Violate any applicable laws or regulations.</li>
          <li>
            Upload or generate content that is illegal, fraudulent, harmful,
            or infringes on the rights of others.
          </li>
          <li>
            Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise discover the
            source code of the Service.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use any automated system to access the Service in a manner that
            sends more request messages to our servers than a human can
            reasonably produce in the same period.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          Excluding User Content, the Service and all materials therein,
          including software, text, graphics, logos, and trademarks, are the
          exclusive property of Sellsnap and its licensors. You may not use
          this property without our prior written consent.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Termination</h2>
        <p>
          We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately,
          without prior notice or liability, if you breach these Terms. Upon
          termination, your right to use the Service will cease immediately.
          All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive
          termination shall survive, including ownership provisions, warranty
          disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>
          THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. TO
          THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SELLSNAP DISCLAIMS ALL
          WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE AND
          YOUR USE THEREOF, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
          WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
          NON-INFRINGEMENT.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          IN NO EVENT SHALL SELLSNAP, ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, OR AGENTS BE
          LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR
          PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS,
          DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM YOUR
          ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
          You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Sellsnap and its
          licensee and licensors, and their employees, contractors, agents,
          officers, and directors, from and against any and all claims,
          damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and
          expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees), resulting
          from or arising out of your use and access of the Service, or a
          breach of these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>13. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in
          which Sellsnap is registered, without regard to its conflict of law
          provisions. Any dispute arising from these Terms or the Service will
          be resolved through binding arbitration, rather than in court.
        </p>

        <h2>14. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will
          provide notice of any material changes by updating the "Last
          updated" date and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a
          more prominent notice. Your continued use of the Service after any
          such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.
        </p>
