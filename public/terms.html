You are solely responsible for your User Content and assume all risks associated with it.</p>

                <h2>6. AI-Generated Content</h2>

                <p>Excluding User Content, the Service and all materials therein, including software, text, graphics, logos, and trademarks, are the exclusive property of Sellsnap and its licensors. You may not use this property without our prior written consent.</p>

                <h2>9. Termination</h2>

                <h2>13. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
                <p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which Sellsnap is registered, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any dispute arising from these Terms or the Service will be resolved through binding arbitration, rather than in court.</p>
